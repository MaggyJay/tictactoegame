# LIVE STEAM Event 2021

The Lenexa and Corporate offices at Terracon partnered with the Girl Scouts of NE Kansas and NW Missouri and Science City for an in-person LIVE STEAM event the evening of Friday November 5, 2021.  

More than 200 local Girl Scouts (4th and 5th grades) came together to explore the world of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) through hands-on workshops.  

This event encourages young ladies to pursue careers in STEAM and is a wonderful opportunity for Terracon to partner with our community.

As an exercise we had the Girl Scouts work their way through the code for the game to find the "bug" (which is represented by a spider emoji) within the game.

I was going for a vintage look and decided on an older Windows operating system-- Windows 95 <a href="https://alexbsoft.github.io/win95.css/">using this custom Windows 95 bootstrap</a> by <a href = "https://alex-b.me/">Alex B</a>.
